The first step in character creation is determining Ability scores. You can either roll random scores, or you can randomly assign a standard set of scores.

To roll for random Ability scores, follow these two easy steps:

1.	Roll 3d6 six times, assigning each result to an Ability in the following order: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma.
2.	If the total of the six scores is less than 62, scrap the character and start over.

If you wish to use the standard set, simply assign the following six numbers in a random order: 15, 16, 13, 12, 10, 9.

Once youâ€™ve assigned your six Ability scores, regardless of the method, you may swap any two scores with each other.
