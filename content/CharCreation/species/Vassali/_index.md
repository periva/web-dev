The Vassali are a species most closely resembled by the lizards and geckoes of Earth. Like chameleons or octopuses, they have the ability to change their coloration, and as a result their appearance varies widely. While their lives are relatively short compared to the other species, they are a very active and energetic species, eager to make the most of their time on the planet. Culturally, they are quite playful and creative.

#### Language

The Vassali language is made up of clicks, chirps, whistles, croaks, and hisses, similar to the sounds made by the reptiles and amphibians of Earth. They can also change the coloration of their skin as a rudimentary form of communication.

#### Life Cycle

The Vassali live relatively short lives, compared to the other playable species of Periva. Their average lifespan is around 53 years, though some have lived as many as 75 or as few as 30 years before dying of old age. Most complete their metamorphosis from childhood to adolescence by age 9, reach full physical maturity by age 12, and complete their mental development by age 15.

Unlike the other species of Periva, the Vassali have very little attachment to their offspring or their kin. During the mating season, which lasts for about a week each year, Vassali will often enter into a frenzy, breeding with numerous mates and laying hundreds of eggs. Most of these will become food for the many predatory species of Periva, and those that hatch rarely live more than a couple years. But those that survive do so with a cunning and creativity which has earned the Vassali quite a reputation amongst the sentient species of the world.

**To determine the starting age of a Vassali character, roll 2d4+7.** If you don’t want to roll, you may choose a starting age between 9 and 15.

#### Customization

Vassali characters gain +2 to their Dexterity or Intelligence and +1 to another Ability of your choosing. They may start with either the **Gills** or **MacGyver** Feat.

Vassali are generally between 4’0” and 5’3” feet tall. If you wish to roll for your height, start with 3’9” and add 3d6 inches.
