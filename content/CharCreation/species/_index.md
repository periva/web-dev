There are many species which call Periva their home. This section details those which players can choose for their characters.

All playable species are medium-sized, between 4 and 8 feet tall. Specific height ranges vary by species. All playable species have a base movement speed of 30’.

All playable species speak Common as well as their own species’ language. The Common language is a simplified hybrid form of the languages of the other species, designed so that all speakers, regardless of their physiology, are capable of pronouncing the words.

**A player’s first character in LToP should always be Human.** When this character dies or retires, the player is free to create any character they wish. (The reasons for this distinction are detailed in the World of Periva setting information.)

**If you’d prefer to choose your species at random,** feel free to roll 2d6 and consult the following table, which takes into account a loose probability based on the population distribution of Periva:

| 2d6 Roll    | Species   | Percentage of Population |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| 2 or 12     | Leafkin   | 5.56%                    |
| 3 or 11     | Reptibian | 11.12%                   |
| 4-5 or 9-10 | Perivan   | 38.88%                   |
| 6-8         | Human     | 44.45%                   |

Each species has unique Feats which are granted upon character creation. These Feats reflect the inherent strengths of that species, adaptations which have helped them survive natural selection.
