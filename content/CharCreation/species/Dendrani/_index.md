The Dendrani are a species of plant-like people who spend their early lives traveling throughout the world before returning to their Ancestor Grove to take root and reproduce. Due to the dangers of Periva, only the strongest and cleverest of their species survive long enough to return to the Grove. As a result, the Dendrani are a hearty species, resistant to toxins and disease. They are, however, the least populous of the sentient species of Periva, as their rate of reproduction is significantly low.

#### Language

Dendrani communicate amongst themselves through pheromonal signals transmitted through the air. However, despite a lack of vocal chords, they have managed to imitate the Common language through the rattling, clicking, and susurrus of their branches and leaves, which generally sounds like a rasping whisper.

#### Life Cycle

Dendrani can live up to 205 years before returning to their Ancestor Grove to take root, though most return around age 132. After taking root and reproducing, Dendrani grow to become great trees, and can survive for many centuries before death. After taking root, any Awakened that might inhabit a Dendrani will depart from its body and be reborn.

Dendrani are spawned from seed pods that hang from their parent tree. Due to natural predation, very few of these pods survive long enough to germinate. Each pod typically takes between 6 to 10 years before sprouting. Until they reach maturity, the Dendrani spend their formative years tending to—and learning from—the other trees in their Ancestor Grove. Dendrani generally reach maturity between the ages of 19 and 41, with an average of around 30 years.

**To determine the starting age for a Dendrani character, roll 2d12+17.** If you don’t want to roll, you may choose a starting age between 19 and 41.

#### Customization

Dendrani characters gain +2 to their Constitution or Wisdom and +1 to another Ability of your choosing. They may start with either the **Leaf-Kin** or **Woodland Ghost** Feat.

Dendrani are generally between 5’10” and 8’7” tall. If you wish to roll for your height, start with 5’7” and add 3d12 inches.
