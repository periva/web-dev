Humans were the last species to settle in Periva. Despite their late arrival, they have quickly outpaced the population of every other species on the planet. This is largely due to Humans’ adaptability and ingenuity, which have enabled them to survive just about anywhere, in any climate.

#### Language

The Human language is based largely on the invented language Esperanto, though it has assimilated a diverse array of words and idioms from the various languages of Earth as well as various Perivan cultures.

#### Life Cycle

Humans in Periva can live up to 115 years, though the average age of mortality is around 79. They begin puberty by age 13, reach physical maturity by age 18, and complete their mental development by age 23.

Human society in Periva varies significantly by region, economic status, and birthright. As such, it is difficult to make generalizations about how they spend their youth and adulthood. Humans have been known to take on many roles, from nobles to pilgrims, merchants to beggars, artists to entertainers, and everything in between.

**To determine the starting age for a Human character, roll 2d6+11.** If you don’t want to roll, you may choose a starting age between 13 and 23.

#### Customization

Human characters gain +2 to one Ability and +1 to another, each of your choosing. They may start with either the **Mob Mentality** or **Well-Traveled** Feat.

Humans are generally between 4’7” to 6’4” tall. If you wish to roll for your height, start with 4’4” and add 3d8 inches.
