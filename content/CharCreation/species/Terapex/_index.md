The Terapex are the dominant species of Periva, despite the Humans’ greater numbers. Their empires spread across the globe long before the Humans arrived, and none but the Humans have ever challenged their dominion. They are a proud mammalian species, somewhat resembling the Fauns, Minotaurs, and Satyrs of early Human mythology on Earth. They differ widely in height and appearance, though all possess tails, bestial faces, and horns of varying length.

#### Language

The Terapex language is made up of the grunts, growls, barks, and other sounds typical of mammalian beasts. While the various Terapex subspecies speak with different voices and sounds, all are capable of understanding each other.

#### Life Cycle

The Terapex subspecies have a wide variety of lifespans, some as short as 56 years, others as long as 155. On average, however, Terapex live around 105 years. Most begin puberty around age 17, reach physical maturity by age 24, and complete their mental development by age 31.

As a communal species, much like the Dendrani, the Terapex spend their youth living and working among their elders. While their parents play an important role in their upbringing, Terapex youth are typically raised and educated by their community. They form strong tribal allegiances during this time. By the age of 24, however, most Terapex leave their tribe in order to prove themselves in the world. They are encouraged to seek alliances in other tribes, to earn glory for their own, and to produce offspring throughout the empires in order to pass along their tribe’s bloodlines. Many Terapex never return to their native tribe, instead opting to settle in another tribe, or in some cases, start their own.

**To determine the starting age of a Terapex character, roll 2d8+15.** If you don’t want to roll, you may choose a starting age between 17 and 31.

#### Customization

Terapex characters gain +2 to their Strength or Charisma and +1 to another Ability of your choosing. They may start with either the **Beast Whisperer** or **Night Sight** Feat.

Terapex are generally between 5’5” and 7’8” tall. If you wish to roll for your height, start with 5’2” and add 3d10 inches.
