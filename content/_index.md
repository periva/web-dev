# Lost Tales of Periva
___
### Gather your friends, and tell a tale...

The World of Periva is vast and ancient. Its lands are scattered with the ruins of long-forgotten civilizations, temples to nameless gods, and deep, labyrinthine dungeons where lost riches and powerful artifacts have lain undisturbed for centuries. The wilderness has reclaimed what the Ancients once conquered, and the tales of these prehistoric places and their denizens are long-since lost to the maelstrom of time.

Yet Periva still thrives, its fallen kingdoms replaced by flourishing new empires which spread across the land, conquering and colonizing the world. Villagers and townspeople work to build a life for themselves, while soldiers and guards fight to protect their citizens from the ravages of beasts and bandits alike. Farmers toil year-round to eke out a living while nomadic tribes wander the forests and deserts, bartering and hunting for survival.

And all throughout, the spirits of the immortal Awakened walk among them, possessing their bodies, venturing forth into those forgotten places of mystery and magic, where terrible foes and unknown riches await. Their tales of adventure and peril span eons, and are written on the face of Periva itself. And while their bodies may die, their spirits are indomitable, blessed and cursed to inhabit the world of Periva unto its end.

#### You are one of the Awakened, destined for a life of danger and glory. What tales will be told of your deeds, adventurer?
