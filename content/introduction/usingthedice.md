LToP uses a standard set of RPG dice. There are seven dice in a complete set, ranging from four to twenty sides. They are referred to by the number of sides they possess. For example, a six-sided die is called a d6. If you need to roll three six-sided dice, this will be referred to as 3d6.

The standard set includes a d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4. It also includes a special die, called the d100, which looks like a d10 but is numbered from 00 to 90. When paired with a d10, the d100 allows you to make percentile rolls (d%) ranging from 1 to 100. To do this, roll both dice together and add the results. For example, if the d10 shows 7 and the d100 shows 20, the result is 27. If the d10 shows 0 and the d100 shows 00, the result is 100.

If the player does not have a d100, they can simply roll a d10 twice. The first roll is the tens place, and the second roll is the ones place. Therefore if they roll a 2 followed by a 7, the result is 27. If both rolls show 0, the result is 100.

The d20 is a special die. Nearly every challenge a character faces will be resolved with a roll of the d20, whether attacking an opponent in battle, avoiding traps in a dungeon, or even haggling with a merchant. The d20 will be used more than any other die.
