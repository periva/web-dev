This guide assumes that you already understand the basic concepts of Role-Playing Games. This section is designed to outline the basic terms you'll need to know to play Lost Tales of Periva.

#### Game Master
The Game Master (GM) is a player designated as the referee of the game, enforcing the rules and making rulings on the various situations that the PCs encounter in their adventures. The GM also decides what happens in the fictional world of the game, acting out the parts of the various NPCs, creatures, and monsters. They create the world in which the characters live, and (with the help of the rules and the dice) determine the fate of the PCs.

#### Non-Player Character
Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are the fictional characters that are controlled by the Game Master.

#### Player Character
Player Characters (PCs) are the fictional characters controlled by the players of the game.

#### Party
The Party is the group of PCs represented by the players at the table. Many groups like to come up with a unique name for their band of adventurers, though this is not entirely necessary.

#### Ability
The Abilities are the six core attributes which define a creature’s inherent qualities. These six abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, commonly abbreviated as Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, and Cha. Abilities are represented by numbers which generally range from 3 to 18, though they can be as low as 1 or as high as 20.

#### Skill
A character’s Skills are representations of their training and expertise in a variety of activities. Skills are represented by numbers ranging between 0 (untrained) to 6 (expert).

#### Feat
Feats represent the unique qualities of a character which grant them special bonuses or abilities in certain situations. Some Feats are given during character creation, while others are purchased with Experience Points.

#### Experience Point
Experience Points (XP) are a type of currency which reflect the knowledge and experience gained by the players throughout their adventures. XP can be used to purchase improvements for your character, making them stronger, more capable adventurers.

#### RPG Dice
RPG Dice are a special set of polyhedral dice, each with a different number of sides. There are seven dice in a complete set, ranging from four sides all the way up to twenty sides. They are referred to by the number of sides they possess. For example, a six-sided die is called a d6, and if you need to roll three six-sided dice, this will be referred to as rolling 3d6.

#### Action
Actions are the various things characters can do in the game. Everything from attacking a feral wolf to chatting with a barkeep is considered an action. Some actions are simple, while others are more difficult.

#### Challenge
Challenges are particularly risky actions which could result in failure or negative consequences. Most challenges will be resolved by rolling dice.

#### Scene
A Scene is a series of connected events that happens in one particular location.

#### Encounter
An Encounter is a scene in which two or more characters, creatures, or monsters are engaged in some form of conflict. This could be anything from a verbal argument to full-scale, deadly combat.

#### Session
A Session is the period of gameplay starting from the point when everyone arrives and starts playing and ending when everyone decides to wrap things up. Sessions generally comprise multiple scenes and encounters. Sessions are typically short, ranging from 2 to 4 hours, though there’s nothing preventing a group from playing for a longer period of time.

#### Adventure
An Adventure is a single quest or mission in which the PCs face opposition in the hopes of achieving a goal. Adventures vary in length, ranging from a “one-shot,” single-session adventure all the way up to an epic, multi-session quest.

#### Campaign
A Campaign is a long-term series of sessions which comprises many connected adventures. Campaigns can last anywhere from months to years, depending on how long the players and GM decide to keep it running. Players will typically aim to play the same PCs throughout the entire campaign, though it is possible for characters to retire or die during the course of a campaign, requiring their player to create a new character in order to continue playing.
