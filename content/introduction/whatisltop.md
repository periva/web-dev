Lost Tales of Periva (LToP) is a rules-light fantasy Role-Playing Game set in the World of Periva campaign setting. LToP is designed to be simple to learn without sacrificing depth of play. It can be played without miniatures, battle-mats or other expensive accessories. All you need is this guide, a complete set of RPG dice, some pencils and paper, and some friends.

In LToP, you will play as one of the Awakened, an immortal spirit which inhabits the world of Periva. Each character you create and play represents a denizen of Periva which is inhabited by your Awakened spirit. When one character dies or retires, your spirit is transferred to the next character you create, bringing some of its knowledge and experience along with it. In this way, even if your first character dies, the next can continue your saga, and so on.
